## Local testing branch

For much better development experience it's recommended to clone the repo locally,
install `miniserve` (or any other HTTP files sharing tool), checkout to
`local-testing` branch and host the whole repo. This branch contains the same
packages as the main one, except all the links are replaced to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Note that this branch is not updated regularly and you might need to merge
the main branch into it.
